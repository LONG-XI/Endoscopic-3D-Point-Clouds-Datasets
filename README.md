# Endoscopic-3D-Point-Clouds-Datasets


We create 5 classes of endoscopic 3D point clouds datasets from the public available Hamlyn Centre Laparoscopic/Endoscopic video datasets http://hamlyn.doc.ic.ac.uk/vision/. 

Our datasets include scenes of abdomen wall, uterine horn, nephrectomy scene 1, nephrectomy scene 2 and the liver and we make the datasets publicly available to researchers at https://drive.google.com/file/d/11WRGB63X6eR6hd5i1tpem7PkICh8gkMD/view?usp=sharing. Each dense 3D point cloud extracted contains approximately 100,000 points on average.
